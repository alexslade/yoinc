Note: This is crappy code, written on a couple of train journeys, I haven't planned the game out very well. Help me make it more fun :) 

### Setup

This is a [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) application. To run in, clone this repository to your local machine, make sure you have the [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite/) package manager installed and run `mrt` in the project directory. 

### Ideas 

Please feel free to think about how to improve the game. 

* Upgrades
* Balancing
* Progression
* Mechanics

Everything is up for debate, just open an Issue to talk about it. 

### BugFixes

Either open an issue describing the bug, or submit a pull request for quicker resolution.
